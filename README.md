# MLTDTools

Tools for THE iDOLM@STER Million Live! Theater Days (MiriShita/ミリシタ). A sister project of [OpenCGSS/DereTore](https://github.com/OpenCGSS/DereTore).

This repository:

- contains some common tools to explore possibilities.
- does not serve as a card/event/CG/commu database. If you want that please visit [ミリシタDB](http://imas.gamedbs.jp/mlth/).
- DOES NOT PROVIDE TOOLS FOR YOU TO CHEAT. **Cheating is not fun at all, and it must be punished.**

Some sensitive information is hidden so some projects may not compile if you simply clone this repo.

## Details

TBD

To run the Unity project you need Unity 5.4+, but NO LATER THAN 5.6.x. Recommended version is 5.6.2f1, which is also the one that MLTD is built with.
