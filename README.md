# MLTDTools (MiriTore)

Tools for [THE iDOLM@STER Million Live! Theater Days](https://millionlive.idolmaster.jp/theaterdays/) (MiriShita/ミリシタ). A sister project of [OpenCGSS/DereTore](https://github.com/OpenCGSS/DereTore).

This repository:

- contains some common tools to explore possibilities.
- does not serve as a card/event/CG/commu database. If you want that please visit [ミリシタDB](http://imas.gamedbs.jp/mlth/).
- DOES NOT PROVIDE TOOLS FOR YOU TO CHEAT. **Cheating is not fun at all. It must be punished.**

For the Unity project for resource generation, please visit [PlatiumTheater](https://github.com/OpenMLTD/PlatiumTheater).
